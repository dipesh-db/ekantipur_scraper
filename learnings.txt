Project Learnings: Ekantipur Scraper

1. Handling Timeouts (Networkidle vs. Domcontentloaded):
   Initially, I used `wait_until="networkidle"`, but the script crashed
   with a 30s TimeoutError. This happened because news sites have constant 
   background network activity (ads/analytics). I switched to `wait_until="domcontentloaded"`
   which waits only for the HTML structure to be ready, making the script
   stable and much faster.

2. Understanding and Handling Lazy Loading: 
   I learned that modern websites optimize performance by deferring image 
   loading until the user scrolls, a technique known as "Lazy Loading." 
   In the DOM, this is often implemented by storing the high-quality image 
   URL in a data-src attribute instead of the standard src. I updated my 
   scraper's logic to prioritize checking data-src first, ensuring I captured 
   the actual image content even if the browser hadn't fully rendered it yet.

3. Dealing with Developer Typos:
   While inspecting the Cartoon section, I couldn't select the wrapper 
   using logical class names. Upon close inspection, I discovered a typo 
   in the production code: `.catroon-wrap` (spelled 'tr' instead of 'rt'). 
   This taught me to trust the Inspector over my own spelling assumptions.

4. Handling Nested Elements (Child Selectors): 
   Upon close inspection of the DOM, I found that the .cartoon-author 
   div was nested inside the main .catroon-wrap container, acting as a
   direct child alongside the image. While I could have used a specific 
   path like wrap.query_selector(".cartoon-author"), I learned that using 
   a global page selector for the unique class name was a simpler and equally 
   effective way to retrieve the data.
   
5. Visual Translation vs. Source Code:
   I was confused when the browser showed the cartoon title in 
   English ("That's amazing, bro") but the scraper returned Nepali 
   ("गजब छ बा"). I realized the browser's auto-translate feature 
   modifies the DOM visually, but the scraper sees the raw, 
   original source code.

6. Efficient Looping (The 'Break' Statement):
   The `.listLayout .row` selector can appear multiple times 
   on the page (for Music, Trending, etc.). To ensure I only 
   got the specific Entertainment news, I added a category 
   validation check and a `break` statement to stop the loop 
   immediately after processing the first main shelf.

7. Implicit vs. Explicit Authors:
   The cartoon section doesn't always have a standard `.author` 
   tag like the news section. I had to create specific logic 
   to target the `.cartoon-author` class, ensuring the JSON output 
   remains consistent across different content types.
