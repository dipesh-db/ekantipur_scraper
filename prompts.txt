Write a Python script using sync_playwright to scrape news from 'https://ekantipur.com/entertainment'. It should navigate to the page, wait for the '.listLayout .row' selector. Iterate through the rows to find the category name (from '.cat_name') and extract the top 5 articles (title, author, image) from that section. Handle lazy loading for images (data-src).

Write a Python script using playwright.sync_api to scrape ekantipur.com.

Task 1: Entertainment News
Navigate to https://ekantipur.com/entertainment.
Wait for the selector .listLayout .row.
Use a standard Python loop (do not use eval_on_selector) to iterate through the rows.
Inside the first row only, extract the Category Name (.cat_name) and the top 5 articles (article.normal).
For each article, get the Title (h2), Author (.author), and Image.
Note: Handle lazy loading for images by checking data-src first, then src.

Task 2: Cartoon of the Day
Navigate to https://ekantipur.com/cartoon.
Wait for the class .catroon-wrap (Note: This class has a typo 'tr' instead of 'rt', use it exactly as written).
Extract the Image Src and use the Image Alt text as the Title.
Extract the Author from the neighbor element .cartoon-author.
Output: Save all data (Entertainment + Cartoon) into a single valid JSON file named output.json with ensure_ascii=False to support Nepali text.
